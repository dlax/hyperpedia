# Concept Template

This is an attempt to describe the concepts in a more structured way. What should be described for each concept:

* The title
* Maybe an acronym/shortname (something that's easy to use as a fragment identifier)
* A brief overview/abstract (one sentence)
* A longer explanation (one or a few paragraphs)
* A specific explanation why this helps and how it helps (linking to other concepts when appropriate)
* A specific explanation when this might be necessary, and when not (allowing to decide if/how to use the concept)
* Any number (greater zero) of the concept in some existing format (linking to the format description)
