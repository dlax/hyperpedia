# XML Linking Language (XLink)

The _XML Linking Language (XLink)_ is a generalized linking model and language that has been designed to be used in XML-based hypermedia formats. It exists in two versions, [XLink 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/) and [XLink 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/), but since these versions [do not differ in terms of their hypermedia features](http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/#changes), this description covers both.
