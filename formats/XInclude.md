# XML Inclusions 1.0 (XInclude 1.0)

[XInclude 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/) is a general-purpose inclusion mechanism for [XML](XML.md)-based data formats. The idea of XInclude is that inclusions are being performed on an XML tree model of a document, and yield an XML tree model that has additional parts in it that have been included from URI-identified XML resources.
