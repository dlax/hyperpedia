# Format Template

This is an attempt to describe the formats in a more structured way. What should be described for each format:

* The name
* Maybe an acronym/shortname (something that's easy to use as a fragment identifier)
* A brief overview/abstract (one sentence)
* A longer explanation (one or a few paragraphs)
* For each concept the format uses, explain how and why (what can be done with it)
* How the format relates to other formats (if it does)
