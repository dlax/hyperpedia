# XML Inclusions (XInclude)

[XInclude](http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/) is a general-purpose inclusion mechanism for [XML](XML.md)-based data formats. The idea of XInclude is that inclusions are being performed on an XML tree model of a document, and yield an XML tree model that has additional parts in it that have been included from URI-identified XML resources.


## xi:include Element

XInclude's [xi:include Element](http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#include_element) is used for representing the information about the included resource, and how it should be included.
