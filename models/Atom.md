# Atom

[Atom](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287) is an [XML](XML.md)-based format for publishing "feeds" that contain lists of related information know as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached metadata. The primary use case that Atom addresses is the syndication of Web content such as weblogs and news headlines to Web sites as well as directly to user agents.
