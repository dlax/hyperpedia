# Hyperpedia

Hyperpedia is an attempt to loosely describe a set of concepts that are interesting in the context of [hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia) formats. The goal is to provide a starting set that hypermedia developers can look at. It might also be interesting to look at existing hypermedia formats and see if and how they represent these concepts, which makes it a little easier to compare and contrast existing hypermedia formats in terms of the linking capabilities.

The end goal is to provide a comprehensive and format-independent overview of Web-oriented hypermedia features (hence the name _Hyperpedia_), and to describe existing formats within the context of that framework.


## Contents

As a starting point, the intention is to describe concepts, and formats. To keep things simple, this is organized as follows:

* [A list of hypermedia concepts](concepts.md) is managed in a single file unless it gets too big to make that look like a reasonable option.

* [A list of hypermedia formats](formats.md) is managed in a directory and should contain individual files for each hypermedia format, relating the hypermedia features of the format to the concepts.

This is intended as a collaborative effort of the hypermedia and REST community, so please feel free to comment, contribute, and fork as you please.
