# Hyperpedia

Hyperpedia describes a set of concepts that are interesting in the context of [hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia) models. The goal is to provide a starting set of concepts that hypermedia developers can look at, either when working with, or when developing new hypermedia models. It also is interesting to look at existing hypermedia models and to see if and how they represent these concepts. This makes it easier to compare and contrast existing hypermedia models in terms of their hypermedia features.

The ultimate goal (and one that's a moving target) is to provide a *comprehensive* and *format-independent* overview of Web-oriented hypermedia features (hence the name _Hyperpedia_), and to describe *existing formats* within the context of that framework.


## Contents

As a starting point, the intention is to describe concepts, and models. To keep things simple, this is organized as follows:

* [A list of hypermedia concepts](concepts.md) is managed in a single file (until it gets too big to make that look like a reasonable option).

* [A list of hypermedia models](models.md) is managed in a directory and should contain individual files for each hypermedia model, relating the hypermedia features of the model to the concepts.

* Preliminary lists of concepts for [hypermedia](concept-template.md) and [models](model-template.md) that later on should be used to create a more structured version of Hyperpedia.
